    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This simple and hearty Viking-style breakfast would have been cooked over an open flame using iron cauldrons and wooden utensils, and served on wooden bowls and platters. The use of ingredients such as goat's milk, barley flour, and rye flour reflects the dietary habits of the Viking Age, while the cooking techniques and utensils reflect the cultural traditions of the time.</p>
